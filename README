libsdb is a C library for accessing Amazon SimpleDB from C or C++ programs.
This is a free software distributed under a BSD-like license; please see
LICENSE for details.


  Prerequisites
-----------------

Before installing this library, make sure that the following packages and
all their prerequisities are installed:

  * gcc-c++
  * curl-devel
  * libxml2-devel
  * openssl-devel


  Install from Source
-----------------------

Perform the following sequence of commands:

  * make
  * sudo make install


  Linking with your Program
-----------------------------

When compiling your program, use the flags returned by the following program:

  sdb-config --cflags

When linking, youse the following:

  sdb-config --libs


  Using in a Program
----------------------

First, include sdb.h:

  #include <sdb.h>

Inside your program, first initialize the library by calling:

  sdb_global_init();

Note that calling this function will also initialize Curl. Then, declare and
initialize a SDB handle:

  struct SDB* sdb;
  ...
  sdb_init(&sdb, aws_id, aws_secret);

The library functions are not thread safe, so you should not share an SDB
handle between multiple thread. When you are done, destroy the handle using:

  sdb_destroy(&sdb);

And then perform a global cleanup:

  sdb_global_cleanup();


  Running a Command
---------------------

If a command produces output, first declare a variable to which it will be
assigned:

  struct sdb_response* res;

Then call the command. For example, in order to get all attributes of a given
item:
  
  int r;
  ...
  r = sdb_get_all(sdb, "domain", "item", &res);

Every command returns an integer. Use the macro SDB_FAILED(r) in order to
determine whether the command returned an error. The constants for error
codes are declared at the top of sdb.h.

Assuming the command succeeded, res would contain the list of all attributes
of the given item. In particular, res->size contains the number of the returned
key-value pairs, which can be accessed through the res->attributes array. The
following code will print the result:

  for (i = 0; i < res->size; i++) {
    printf("%s = %s\n", res->attributes[i].name, res->attributes[i].value);
  }

When you are done, release the response structure by calling:

  sdb_free(&res);

All commands and the response structure are documented by the Doxygen-style
comments in the include file sdb.h.
